# Who Are You!

This seems like a request header modification question. It says use `Pico Browser` so I changed user agent then it says `I don't trust users visiting from another site.`  
Im guessing it has something to do with `CORS` but idk now

# Method
It turns out that we need to satisfy multiple requirements in the header in order to get the flag. Please refer to the script.
