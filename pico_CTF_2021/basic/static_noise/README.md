# Static Noise

This is a very simple challenge. All we need to do is pass the static binary file to to provided disassembler. First, we mark the `ltdis.sh` script as executable then we pass in the `static` file as `arg[0]`

## Strings

We could also run strings on the binary and both ways, we get a list of printable strings in the binary and the flag could be found there.
