# picoCTF 2021
picoCTF 2021 has been a great event, especially during unprecedented times(COVID-19).  I was able to complete most of the challenges leaving some `pwn` and `rev` challengs unsolved.  
## Results
Personally, I scored `8700` points and my team `SqU4dR0n` scored `9120` points placing us at `5th` in Canada and `17th` worldwide.
## Takeaways
I learnt a lot about almost every category but I have to say that I've learnt the most in `crypto`, `pwn` and `rev`. Although I wasn't able to clear these three categories, the remaining challenges were out of my reach.  
I learnt a lot during this process wheter it's new tools or techniques, they all helped develop me as a programmer.
## Special Thanks
Special thanks to `@ZeroDayTea` and `@ers123` who gave me inspirations and directions when I am stuck.  
Special thanks to the `UCC Coding Club` and `Mr. Miskew` for giving me the oppertunity to share this event with the school.  
Finally, thanks to all the moderators and admins of this event! All the challenges were awesome!
