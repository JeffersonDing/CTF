  There's not a lot of useful functions in the binary itself. I wonder where you can get some...

  `nc {{host}} {{port}}`
provide:
- ./bin/the-library
- ./bin/the-library.c
- ./bin/libc.so.6
flag:
  file: ./bin/flag.txt

containers:
  main:
    build: .
    replicas: 2
    ports:
    - 9999
expose:
  main:
  - target: 9999
    tcp: 31350
