  Okay, so maybe using unsafe code was a bad idea. But now we're fine,
  right?

  `nc {{host}} {{port}}`
provide:
- ./tetanus-shot.tar.gz
- ./bin/tetanus_shot.rs
flag:
  file: ./bin/flag.txt

containers:
  main:
    build: .
    replicas: 2
    ports:
    - 9999
expose:
  main:
  - target: 9999
    tcp: 31754
