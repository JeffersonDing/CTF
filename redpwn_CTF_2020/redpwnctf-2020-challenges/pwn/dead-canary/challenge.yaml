  It is a terrible crime to slay a canary. Killing a canary will keep your
  exploit alive even if you are an inch from segfaults. But at a terrible
  price.

  `nc {{host}} {{port}}`

  **NOTE:** This and later pwn problems provide Dockerfiles
  
  To run on localhost:1337 with the current directory mounted at `/ctf`,
  ```
  tar xf dead-canary.tar.gz && echo fake_flag > bin/flag.txt && docker run -v ${PWD}:/ctf --cap-add=SYS_PTRACE --rm --name redpwnctf-dead-canary -itp 1337:9999 $(docker build -q .)
  ```

  You can get a shell with,
  ```
  docker exec -it redpwnctf-dead-canary bash
  ```

  We've also provided a simple install script to help setup an environment quickly.
  ```
  apt-get update && apt-get install -qy curl && curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/redpwn/dockerfiles/master/quick-install.sh | sh
  ```
provide:
- ./dead-canary.tar.gz
flag:
  file: ./bin/flag.txt

containers:
  main:
    build: .
    replicas: 2
    ports:
    - 9999
expose:
  main:
  - target: 9999
    tcp: 31744
