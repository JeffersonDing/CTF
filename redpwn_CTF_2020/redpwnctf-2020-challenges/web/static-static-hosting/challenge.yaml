  Seeing that my last website was a success, I made a version where instead
  of storing text, you can make your own custom websites! If you make something cool,
  send it to me [here](https://admin-bot.redpwnc.tf/submit?challenge=static-static-hosting)

  Site: {{link}}

  Note: The site is entirely static. Dirbuster will not be useful in solving it.
