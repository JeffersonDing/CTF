# got-stacks

There is a waf in place to protect against sql injection and there is a injectable parameter.
* First, the attacker must bypass the waf to read a file (flag.txt).
* Second, the attacker must exfiltrate the file read, bypassing the private ip check.
* The hard part of the challenge should be bypassing the waf.

Source code will be provided.
