  Someone gave me this weird knockoff game console and I think it's hiding a
  flag. I managed to dump the firmware and host it on this server; can you take
  it from here?


  `nc {{host}} {{port}}`
provide:
- ./bin/nii
flag: flag{shellcoding_is_a_rev_skill,_too!_8F13E8F6}

containers:
  main:
    build: .
    replicas: 2
    ports:
    - 9999
expose:
  main:
  - target: 9999
    tcp: 31215
