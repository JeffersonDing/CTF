  Fishy is trying to hack into a secret government website again!!! 
  
  They learned from fishy's attempts last year, so they created a password of **10^5** integers, and each integer x in the password satisfies **0 <= x <= 2^31**. However, this password was too long for them to check, so they made up a method that they hoped was quicker. They included **10^5** tests that the password checker will do.

  In each test, the computer checks from some left bound L to some right bound R, where **1 <= L <= R <= 10^5**. The computer takes the xor of each value in the range L to R inclusive of the password and checks if that equals the expected value V. Fishy has found the the values for L, R, V for each test, but he needs your help to find a valid password. Can you help him?

  You will be given the L, R, and V values for each test, and each test will be
  on their own line. For example, the first few tests could look something like:

  ```
  1 4 6
  5 12 9
  574 990 743485
  ...
  ```

  Print back the values in the array, each separated by a newline

  `nc {{host}} {{port}}`
flag:
  file: ./bin/flag.txt

containers:
  main:
    build: .
    ports:
    - 9999
expose:
  main:
  - target: 9999
    tcp: 31458
