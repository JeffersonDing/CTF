  Another pyjail. Yup. Just, this time, it's a payload golfing challenge.

  `nc {{host}} {{port}}`

  **UPDATE:** The strict blacklist is bypassable using a "read the man page /
  docs / spec"-style trick. Don't get too stuck trying to bypass it.

provide:
- ./albatross.py
- Dockerfile
flag:
  file: ./flag.txt

containers:
  main:
    build: .
    ports:
    - 9999
expose:
  main:
  - target: 9999
    tcp: 31156
