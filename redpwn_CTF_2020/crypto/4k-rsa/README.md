# 4k RSA
This is a classic RSA question where we were given `n` `e` and `c`. In this case to decipher `c` we need to find `d` which is the modular inverse of the totient and `e`. 
## Finding the Totient
To find the `Eulers Totient` we need to find the factors of n. Then we could put it in this equation since we know that all of n's factors are prime
```
phi = (p0-1)(p1-1)...(pn-1)
```
To factor a large number like n we could of course use the `Python Crypto` module but we can search for the number on [factordb](www.factordb.com).
### Prime Factorization
We input `n` into factordb and indeed it is already FF(fully factored)

```
This is the prime factorization of `n`
## Script
To find the totient phi, and find the final plaintext, I wrote a small python script to automate the process. I skiped the RSA values as they take up to much space. They could be sound in the provided txt file.
```python
from Crypto.Util.number import inverse
n= #n from provided txt file
e=65537
c= #c from provided txt file
primes= #the primes listed above. Don't want to showcase twice as there is quite a lot of them.
phi=1
for x in primes:
    phi=phi*(x-1)
d = inverse(e,phi)
m=pow(c,d,n)
print(hex(m))
```
Essentially, we set phi to one and multiply it to the next prime factor of `n` minus one. Then we get `d` by doing the moduler inverse of the public exponent and phi. To solve the plaintext, we just need to raise `c` to the power of `d` mod `n`.
